        <h2>Why We Started?</h2>
        <p>My colleagues and I founded MythosWorks Inc. with the belief that imagination should never be limited by cost or dismissed as impossible. Too often, innovative ideas are overlooked by major companies and investors who don’t share the vision of the everyday creator. We believe that accessibility, community, and creativity should drive innovation. That’s why MythosWorks Inc. is dedicated to being a company built for the people, by the people—where ideas are heard, possibilities are explored, and imagination becomes reality.</p>
